## Random Experiment
An experiment having more than one outcome such that the outcome of a particular performance of the experiment cannot be predicted.

## Sample space
Set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space of the experiment.Denoted by S

## Event
An event is a subset of the sample space of a random experiment.

## Mutually exclusive Events
2 events A and B are Mutually exclusive if A and B are disjoint

## Exhaustive Events
Events E1,E2,E3...En are mutually exhaustive if E1 U E2 U E3 U ... U En = S

## Axioms of probability
Probability is a number that is assigned to each member of a collection of events from a random experiment that satisfies the following properties:
If S is the sample space and E is any event in a random experiment,
1. P(S) = 1
2. 0<= P(E) <= 1
3. P(E1 U E2) = P(E1) + P(E2) for 2 mutually exclusive events E1 and E2

## Conditional probability
For 2 events A and B associated with a sample space S,the conditional probability of B given the event A is
P(B/A) = P(A and B) / P(A) whenever  P(A)!=0

## Multiplication rule
P(A intersect B) = P(A/B)P(B) = P(B/A)P(A)

## Independence of Events

2 events A and B are independent if any of the following equivalent statements is true:
1. P(A/B) = P(A)
2. P(B/A) = P(B)
3. P(A intersect B) = P(A)P(B)
