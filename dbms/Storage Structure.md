# Storage Structure

## Volatile storage :

 - Information residing in volatile storage does not usually survive system crashes.
 - Examples of such storage are main memory and cache memory.
 - Access to volatile storage is extremely fast
 - It is possible to access any data item in volatile storage directly.
## Nonvolatile storage :

 - Information residing in non volatile storage survives
system crashes.
 - Examples of non volatile storage include secondary storage
devices such as magnetic disk and flash storage and tertiary storage devices such as optical media, and magnetic tapes.

## Stable storage:
 - Information residing in stable storage is never lost
 - To implement stable storage, we replicate the information in several non volatile storage media with independent failure modes.
